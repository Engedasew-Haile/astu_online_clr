      <h6>A Bit More Personal</h6>
		<h6>Whatâ€™s a Portfolio Project?</h6>
	<p>A portfolio project is a self-directed project that I complete to showcase my skills and abilities.<br> 
	It can be anything from a website to a mobile app to a piece of software.<br> 
	The goal of a portfolio project is to show potential employers or clients what I can do.</p>
	
	<p>There are many reasons to build a portfolio project. But here are a few of the most common for me:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>To showcase my skills and abilities: A portfolio project is a great way to show potential employers or clients what I can do.<br>
		It can be a way to demonstrate my technical skills, my creativity, and my problem-solving skills.</li>
	<br>
	<li>To gain experience: Building a portfolio project is a great way to gain experience in a particular area.<br>
		This can be helpful if I am looking for a job or if I am trying to start my own business.</li>
	<br>
	<li>To learn new skills: A portfolio project can be a great way to learn new skills.<br> 
		If I am interested in learning a new programming language or a new software development tool, a portfolio project can be a great way to get started.</li>
	<br>
	<li>To build my network: Building a portfolio project can help me to build my network. When I share my project with others,<br> 
		I can get feedback from them and I can also connect with people who are interested in my work.</li>
	<br>
	<li>To get noticed: A portfolio project can help me to get noticed by potential employers or clients.<br> 
		When I put my project out there, I am giving people a chance to see what I can do.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Building a portfolio project, there are a few things I need to keep in mind. <br>First, Ineed to choose a project that is relevant to my interests and skills. <br> Second, I need to make sure that the project is well-designed and well-executed. <br>Third, I need to promote my project so that people can see it.</p>
	<p>Building a portfolio project can be a lot of work, but it is worth it. <br>A well-crafted portfolio project can help me to achieve my career goals.</p>

	<h6>Why do I build a Portfolio project?</h6>
	<h7>A portfolio project can serve several different purposes. Here are some of them:</h7>
	<h6>Based on interests and background: </h6>
	<p>A portfolio project can be a great way to showcase my unique interests and skills. <br>When I am networking or interviewing with potential employers, they will be interested in learning more about what I am passionate about and what I am good at. <br>My portfolio project can help me to highlight things.</p>
	<h6>A realistic workplace scenario: </h6>
	<p>A project can also provide me with a realistic workplace scenario (issue). <br>In the workplace, <br>I am often faced with loosely defined requirements and deadlines.<br> My portfolio project can help me to develop the skills necessary to successfully meet challenges.</p>
	<h6>Self-directed learning: </h6>
	<p>A portfolio project can also allow me to engage in self-directed learning. <br>This means that I can choose a project that I am interested in and that I want to learn more about. <br>This can be a great way to deepen my understanding of a technical topic or to explore a new area of interest.</p>
	<h6>Using technology to bring an idea to life:  </h6>
	<p>A portfolio project can also be a way to use technology to bring an idea to life. <br>This can be a great way to showcase my creativity and problem-solving skills.<br>
	When I choose a portfolio project, it is important to consider my interests, skills, and goals.<br> I should also choose a project that is challenging but achievable.<br> By carefully selecting and completing a portfolio project, I could create a valuable asset that will help me to succeed in my career.</p>
	<h6>Some additional tips for creating a successful portfolio project: (google.com)</h6>
	<li>Choose a project that I am passionate about. This will make the project more enjoyable and I will be more likely to see it through to completion.</li>
	<li>Break the project down into smaller, more manageable tasks. This will make the project less daunting and I will be more likely to stay on track.</li>
	<li>Set realistic deadlines for myself. This will help me to avoid feeling overwhelmed and stressed.</li>
	<li>Get feedback from others as I work on the project. This will help me to identify any areas that need improvement.</li>
	<li>Document my progress throughout the project. This will help me to remember what I have done and to track my progress.</li>
	<li>Present my project in a professional way. This will help me to make a good impression on potential employers.</li>

		 This project work is to develop a computer based online clearance for doing clear for graduating students and admin-staff of ASTU. Like any other system, the proposed web-based system has also its own functional scope, focuses on replacing the current manual system into a web-based computerized system and eliminating the problems caused by the manual system in the process. We can better illustrate the scope of the proposed web-based system by listing the services it will provide. Therefore, the scope of this project is focused on design and developing computer based online Clearance system for ASTU.
